vetiver
===================================
The goal of vetiver is to provide fluent tooling to version, share, deploy, and monitor a trained model. Functions handle both recording and checking the modelâ€™s input data prototype, and predicting from a remote API endpoint. 
You can use vetiver with:

- scikit-learn
- pytorch
